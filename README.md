# Kitty Projects

This repository contains a small Kitty project that I built while learning different frameworks. Since it is a learning project, do not expect high-quality code or a large-scale application.

However, I try to maintain a README file for each project to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.

Feel free to explore and learn along with me! ðŸš€
